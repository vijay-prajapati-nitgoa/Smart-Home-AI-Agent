        "\n",
        "*   Design and implement a simple AI agent that interacts with an environment to make decisions based on environmental states.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The agent should be able to sense the environment, decide on an appropriate action, and take that action to achieve a goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The environment will be modeled with variables such as time of day, temperature, and presence of people, and the agent’s task will be to perform actions such as turning lights on/off, adjusting the thermostat, and locking/unlocking doors.\n",

        "* The system should simulate real-time decision-making in a smart home scenario, where the agent reacts to changes in the environment and optimizes its performance accordingly."
