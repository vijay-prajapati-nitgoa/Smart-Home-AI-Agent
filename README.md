AI Agent Based Smart Home Automation System using Python
 Project Overview

This project implements a rule-based AI Agent that simulates a Smart Home Automation System using Python.

The system models a smart home environment where the agent senses environmental conditions such as time of day, temperature, presence of people, and natural light level, and automatically performs appropriate actions.

The AI agent makes intelligent decisions to control home functions such as lights, thermostat, and door locking.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence

Environment Simulation

 System Features

Automatic light control based on natural light and time

Temperature control (Heating / Air Conditioning)

Smart door locking/unlocking based on presence

Real-time interactive simulation

Dynamic environment state updates

How It Works

The Environment class stores environmental variables:

Time of day

Temperature

Presence

Natural light

The AI Agent:

Senses the environment

Applies rule-based logic

Decides actions

Updates smart home status

The system runs in an interactive loop where users can change environmental conditions and observe how the AI agent reacts.

How to Run

Clone the repository

Open the Python file

Run the program

Enter environmental conditions when prompted

Observe the AI agent automatically controlling the smart home

Future Improvements

Add graphical user interface (GUI)

Integrate IoT hardware devices

Add machine learning-based decision making

Voice assistant integration

Real-time sensor data support
